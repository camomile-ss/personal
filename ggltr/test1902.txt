Abstract: We construct the Rarita-Schwinger basis vectors, U µ, spanning the direct product space,
U µ := Aµ ⊗ uM , of a massless four-vector, Aµ, with massless Majorana spinors, uM , together with the
associated ﬁeld-strength tensor, T µν := pµU ν − pνU µ. The T µν space is reducible and contains one massless
subspace of a pure spin-3/2 ∈ (3/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 3/2). We show how to single out the latter in a unique way by acting
on T µν with an earlier derived momentum independent projector, P (3/2,0), properly constructed from one of the
Casimir operators of the algebra so(1, 3) of the homogeneous Lorentz group. In this way it becomes possible to
describe the irreducible massless (3/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 3/2) carrier space by means of the anti-symmetric-tensor of
second rank with Majorana spinor components, deﬁned as(cid:2)w(3/2,0)(cid:3)µν
γδT γδ. The conclusion
is that the (3/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 3/2) bi-vector spinor ﬁeld can play the same role with respect to a U µ gauge ﬁeld as the
bi-vector, (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1), associated with the electromagnetic ﬁeld-strength tensor, Fµν , plays for the Maxwell
gauge ﬁeld, Aµ. Correspondingly, we ﬁnd the free electromagnetic ﬁeld equation, pµFµν = 0, is paralleled by the
free massless Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld equation, pµ(cid:2)w(3/2,0)(cid:3)µν = 0, supplemented by the additional condition,
γµγν(cid:2)w(3/2,0)(cid:3)µν = 0, a constraint that invokes the Majorana sector.

1 Introduction

The spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld, whether it be massive or massless, appears in the theory of super-gravity
where it deﬁnes the gravitino, the super-symmetric partner of the graviton, the gauge boson of a hypothesized
fundamental gravitational interaction. Knowing its properties under Lorentz transformations is indispensable for
testing the predictive power of those ﬁeld theories. The gravitino is considered to transform according to the highest
spin-3/2 of a neutral four-vector spinor carrier space of the enveloping sl(2, C) algebra of the inhomogeneous
Lorentz group algebra, so(1, 3), its standard notation being, (1/2, 1/2) ⊗ [(1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2)] ∼ Aµ ⊗ uM ,
with Aµ denoting one of the four basis vectors spanning the (1/2, 1/2) carrier space of that very same algebra
sl(2, C), and uM standing for a Majorana spinor. This particle is supposed to obey the Rarita-Schwinger equation
[1]–[4]. While for massive ﬁelds this equation is known to suffer several inconsistencies, among them acausal
propagation of the classical wave fronts within an electromagnetic background (Velo-Zwanzinger problem) and
(the Johnson-Sudarshan problem) non-covariant equal-time commutators upon quantization (see [5] for a review
and references therein), the massless ﬁeld has been shown to be free of them. Speciﬁcally in [3] it has been shown
that when considered as a supersymmetric partner to the graviton, the propagation of the massless gravitino is
always causality and covariance respecting. Later on, it was demonstrated that consistent quantum ﬁeld theories

for the massless gravitino can be constructed at both the classical and quantum levels,by employing a combination
of path-integral quantization with Hamiltonian constraint techniques [1], [2]. Instead, canonical quantization alone
has turned out to be insufﬁcient for ﬁelds transforming according to irreducible carrier spaces of the Lorentz
group of the type, (A/2, B/2) (with A, B integer) characterized by multiple spins varying from |(A − B)|/2 to
(A + B)/2 because it is prejudiced by Weinberg’s theorem [6] according to which the helicity of the quantum
state is limited to the lowest one, while the physical helicities have to correspond to the maximal allowed absolute
value. The latter problem of quantization concerns primarily the four-vector used in the description of gauge ﬁelds.
The canonical quantization of a massless gauge ﬁeld equipped by helicities | ∓ 1|, can be achieved by means of
a four-component ﬁeld which, however, does not behave as a four-vector because it transforms inhomogeneously
under Lorentz transformations,

U(Λ)Aµ(x)U −1(Λ) = (cid:0)Λ−1(cid:1)µ

νAν(Λx) + i

∂

∂(Λx)µ

Ω(Λx),

(1)

where Λ is a Lorentz transformation in space time, U(Λ) its representation on the space of the Aµ(x) ﬁelds, and
Ω(Λx) is linear in the particle-annihilation, and anti–particle creation operators. The way out is starting with a
classical Lagrangian whose kinetic term is based upon the ﬁeld-strength tensor, F µν , known to transform as a
single spin-1 and according to the (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1) bi-vector carrier space of the Lorentz group. This Lagrangian,
denoted by L0 and given by,

L0 = −

1
4

F µνFµν , F µν = ∂νAµ − ∂µAν,

(2)

is the only one that is both Lorentz-and gauge invariant, i.e. invariant under Aµ → Aµ − ∂µλ transformations
[7]. In contrast, the Fermi Lagrangian (−(1/2)(∂νAµ)(∂νAµ)) is only Lorentz- but not gauge invariant. The
aforementioned problems hint at the importance of the pure spin carrier spaces of the Lorentz group for canonical
quantization. The problems of the four-vector quantization discussed above extend to the massless spin-3/2 Rarita-
Schwinger ﬁeld described by means of a four-vector spinor. Also in this case, one may expect that expressing the
kinetic term in the corresponding Lagrangian by means of an anti-symmetric tensor-spinor, transforming accord-
ing to single spin-3/2 ∈ (3/2, 0)⊕(0, 3/2), may be useful to canonical quantization (as already pointed out in [8]).
It is the goal of the present study to explicitly construct the aforementioned (3/2, 0)⊕ (0, 3/2) carrier space of the
Lorentz group as a totally anti-symmetric tensor of second rank with Majorana spinor components, and formulate
the related classical Lagrangian in the hope that in this way we lay down the grounds for a canonical constraint
Hamilitonian quantization that could be generalized to any spin. Motivated by the construction of massive four
vectors in [9, 10] we build them from direct products of Weyl (co-)spinors, extending that work to the massless
case. We ﬁrst construct the massless Dirac (u) and Majorana (uM ) spinors, and then also the massless four-vectors
Aµ. We then build the direct products of Fµν with Majorana spinors according to,

T µν
a = pµAν ⊗ [uM ]a − pνAµ ⊗ [uM ]a = pµU ν

a − pνU µ
a ,
U µ
a : = Aµ ⊗ [uM ]a ,

(3)

where U µ
a denotes a Rarita-Schwinger four-vector spinor, while [uM ]a is Majorana spinor. In so doing, one arrives
at a 24 dimensional space spanned by totally anti-symmetric massless tensors of second rank with Majorana spinor
to [(1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1)] ⊗ [(1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2)]. This carrier space splits into an eight dimensional
components, i.e.
irreducible sector of pure spin-3/2, a four-dimensional one of pure spin-1/2, and a 12 dimensional one of mixed
spins 1/2 and 3/2 according to

[(1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1)] ⊗ [(1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2)] ⇒ (cid:20)(cid:18) 3

massless Rarita-Schwinger gravitino.

In this way, an anti-symmetric tensor-spinor of pure spin-3/2 is furnished which is suitable for deﬁning the
kinetic term in the gravitino Lagrangian. This text provides the technical details needed for the realization of the
concepts presented above and is organized as follows. In the next section a concise review of the fundamentals
of the SL(2, C) group, the universal covering of the homogeneous Lorentz group, is presented with the aim to
reach in a transparent way the Weyl equations and their solutions, the Weyl spinors and co-spinors, which we
then employ in section 3 in the construction of massless Majorana spinors, and massless four-vectors, thereby
preparing the building blocks of the massless Rarita-Schwinger four-vector spinors. We compare the outcome for
the massless four vectors with Wigner’s little group approach in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to our prime result,
the construction of the totally anti-symmetric tensor-spinor transforming as (3/2, 0)⊕ (0, 3/2), together with some
of its properties. The text closes with a brief summary section.

2 The Weyl equations

According to the contemporary understanding, space and time are uniﬁed by transformations of the pseudo-
orthogonal group SO(1, 3), the Lorentz group, with the basis of its fundamental representation being given by
a four-vector, Aµ, with µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, in standard notation [12]. The space spanned by the four-vectors is then the
Minkowski space of Einstein’s special relativity. However, from a purely mathematical point of view, orthogonal
and pseudo-orthogonal groups appear as factor groups of more basic groups, the so called spin-groups, and the
fundamental representations of the former present themselves as tensor products of the fundamental representa-
tions of the latter. Speciﬁcally the homogeneous Lorentz group is the factor group of SL(2, C) (the special linear
group in a two dimensional complex space) with respect to its Abelian subgroup Z2 (the center of the group) [13],
[14].

The SL(2, C) group has six generators deﬁned by the Pauli matrices as, σ1/2, σ2/2, σ3/2, and iσ1/2, iσ2/2,

iσ3/2, whose commutators,

constitute the algebra, denoted by lower case letters as sl(2, C), of the SL(2, C) group. The commutators in (9) are
a subset of the Clifford algebra of the lowest order. This group is known to have two non-equivalent fundamental
representations, their respective bases being two dimensional vectors with complex components termed as spinors,

ζα, and co-spinors, η (cid:5)

The SL(2, C) transformations generated by iσj/2 act distinctly on the spinors and the co-spinors (also termed Van
der Waerden spinors) and are given by the so-called right (R) - and left (L)-handed boosts,

(16)

(17)

The transformations generated by the σi/2 matrices alone, exp(i~p · ~σ), are the rotations constituting an SU (2)
subgroup, and are the same for both types of spinors.
It can be shown that all the irreducible carrier spaces of the sl(2, C) algebra can be constructed from reducing
all the possible direct products of r spinors, and n co-spinors with r and n taking all non-negative natural values.

Speciﬁcally, direct products of spinors and co-spinors give rise to the four-vectors deﬁning the fundamental repre-
sentation of the Lorentz group, SO(1, 3), which are understood in the above scheme as spinor–co-spinor tensors
of rank one, i.e. Aµ ∼ ζαη

spinor spaces are deﬁned as,

The solutions to the right-handed Weyl equations are the Weyl co-spinors, while the solutions of the respective

left-handed equations are Weyl spinors, here in turn denoted by

(cid:5)

φ and χ, respectively.

It is straightforward to check that the following (so far not normalized) solutions for

(cid:5)

φ and χ hold valid:

In setting px = py = 0, and E = pz one sees that

φ corresponds to helicity (−1/2), while the helicity of χ is
φ carries a spin that is anti-parallel to the z axis (in which case the symbol ↓ is used),

(25)

(cid:5)

while the spin of the χ spinor is oriented along it, ↑, then two more Weyl equations, describing co-spinors with ↑
and spinors with ↓, can be obtained from the above two by reversing the momentum as, pz → −pz. Under this
change (20) becomes,

It can be checked that the four spinors,

(cid:5)τ are orthogonal and they are all necessary as building
blocks of Dirac’s massless four-component u and v spinors. The four different direct products among the above
Weyl spinors with the co-spinors will be shown in the following to provide the building blocks of the massless
four vector. Finally, we wish to point out that the Weyl equations can alternatively be derived also from the
representation theory of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group with the aid of the Pauli-Lubanski pseudo-vector, a
result reported in [15], [16].

The corresponding v± spinors are then obtained from the u± spinors through the relationship, v± = γ5u±, where

way as

approach inspired by [9], [10] where the massive four-vectors have been described in terms of direct products of

It can be shown that all the Ai four-vectors are mutually orthogonal for p2 = 0 according to the Minkowski metric,
G,

Ai ¯Aj = δij ,

¯Aj = A†

jG, G = diag(1,−1,−1,−1).

(45)

Also because A4 is equal to the SO(1, 2) linear momentum (see the following section), its orthogonality to the

direction of propagation,

A4 ¯Aj =

For the sake of what follows, it is important to notice that the vectors A1 and A3 are also divergenceless with

Since the A2 vector is constant in any frame – see (44) – it also falls into the trivial representation of SO(1, 2)
and thus decouples from the remaining three, it is no longer available to the construction of a massless vector, a
reason for which the Weyl spinor approach describes massless momenta in an implicit way through the mass-shell
condition on the light cone in (44). The Weyl spinor approach does not lead to any null vectors. More light on this
issue will be shed in the next section.

3.3 Classiﬁcation of the massless four-vectors by the Casimir invariant of the so(1, 2)

algebra

It is straightforward to verify that the Ai vectors span bases of SO(1, 2) irreducible representations. In order to
see this, recall the so(1, 2) algebra given by

so(1, 2) :

[K+, K−] = −2Lz,
[K±, Lz] = ∓K±,

K± = Kx ± iKy.

(49)

The respective generators of boosts along the x and y axes, Kx and Ky, and the generator of rotation around the z
axis, Lz , are represented by the following matrices,

The so(1, 2) algebra has one Casimir invariant, C, deﬁned as

C = L2

z − K 2

x − K 2
y ,

whose action on the Ai vectors is

CAi = f (f + 1)Ai = 2Ai with f = 1 for

i = 1, 3, 4,

CA2 = 0,

(51)

(52)

meaning that A1, A3, and A4 provide the basis of a three-dimensional non-unitary SO(1, 2) representation, while
A2 deﬁnes an so(1, 2) singlet.

The so(1, 2) Casimir invariant in (51) can be simultaneously diagonalized with any one of the three generators
in (50) constituting the so(1, 2) algebra, for example with Lz, arriving in this way to vectors that, next to the
f -quantum number, are labelled also by the Lz eigenvalues, denoted by m, according to

C |f, mi = f (f + 1)|f, mi , Lz |f, mi = m|f, mi ,

|m| ≤ f.

(53)

However, because Lz is not an so(1, 2) invariant, such a simultaneous diagonalization is not frame independent.
However, in the particular frame, px = py = 0, the standard textbook right-and left-handed circular polarization
vectors, ǫ1,1, and ǫ1,−1 are recovered as,

K+ǫ1,1 = K−ǫ1,−1 = 0,

K+ǫ1,−1 = K−ǫ1,1 = √2eiπn, K±n = ∓

√2ǫ1,±1.

(57)

The equations (54) and (55) show that the A1 and A3 four-vectors in the equations (41) and (42) can be considered
as the boosted transverse polarizations, ǫ1,1, and ǫ1,−1, respectively. This observation, together with eq. (47)
qualiﬁes A1 and A3 as building blocks in the construction of the massless Rarita-Schwinger four-vector spinors in
Section 5 below. In coordinate space, the vectors in (54)-(56) take the shape of the pseudo-spherical harmonics via
1 (cosh ρ)eimϕ, with r = (sinh ρ cos ϕ, sinh ρ sin ϕ, cosh ρ) being a vector in an (1 + 2)

representation as a differential operator [18].
y = 2(E + pz)pz, the (−iA2) =
e0,0 ≡ ez four-vector is constant, which implies that the Lorentz transformations are represented on it by the
identity element. Put another way, this means that (−iA2) = ez transforms according to a trivial representation.
In this way the massless (1/2, 1/2) representation of the Lorentz group, in contrast to the massive one [9], [10],
is not irreducible but splits into a trivial representation, i.e. an so(1, 2) singlet, deﬁned by the constant vector,
(−iA2) = ez, coinciding with the unit vector of the z axis, on one side, and an so(1, 2) triplet constituted by the

two vectors, (−iA1) = ǫ1,1, and (−iA3) = ǫ1,−1, of negative norms, and time-like vector (−iA4) = ǫ1,0 ≡ n of a
positive norm, on the other. In this fashion, within the scheme worked out here, the purely space-like polarization
ˆez, transversal to ǫ1,1 and ǫ1,−1, drops out of the kinematics of real massless spin-1 gauge ﬁelds, such as photons
and gluons. The major conclusion of the current section is that massless four vectors in the Weyl spinor approach
are treated as massive vectors in a (1 + 2) dimensional space time, with the z component of the embedding (1 + 3)
dimensional space-time taking the role of “mass.”

In the subsequent section we shall compare the framework of the present study with Wigner’s little group approach
to massless particles.

4 Classiﬁcation of the massless four-vectors by the helicity quantum num-

ber and Wigner’s little group method

A brief comparison of the SL(2, C) approach to massless states employed here with Wigner’s induced repre-
sentation method based on E(2) as the little group is in order. The Euclidean group E(2) is deﬁned as the
semi-direct, ⋊, product of the (Abelian) translation group on a plane, T2, with the SO(2) group of rotations,
i.e. E(2) = T2 ⋊ SO(2) and has been suggested by Wigner as a group whose representations induce in the Lorentz
group the massless representations. The E(2) generators can be chosen as the generator, Lz of rotation around the
z axis, and the two generators, Πx and Πy, of transverse translations on the light cone, deﬁned as [19], [20]

They commute with each other, [Πx, Πy] = 0, while their commutators with Lz is given by,

Πx = Kx + Ly,

Πy = Ky − Lx.

[Πx, Lz] = −iΠy,

[Πx, Lz] = iΠx.

(58)

(59)

Therefore, the three generators, Πx, Πy, and Lz form the “Poincare” algebra of an Euclidean 2D space. Since E(2)
is non-compact, its unitary irreducible representations are inﬁnite dimensional, while the ﬁnite dimensional ones
are non-unitary. Here we are especially interested in Minkowski four-vectors, in whose space the E(2) generators
can be represented by the following matrices:

Πx =


It is easy to verify that the Πx and Πy operators have the property of annihilating the vector,

, Πy =

(61)

the Lz eigenstates associated to the zero eigenvalue that are the linear combination of ǫ1,0 ≡ n from (56) and the
unit vector along the z axis, ez from (44). Furthermore, the operators,

Π± = Πx ± iΠy,

have the following laddering property,

Πx(ǫ1,0 − ez) = Πy(ǫ1,0 − ez) = 0, Π±ǫ1,∓1 = ±i√2(ǫ1,0 − ez).

(62)

(63)

11

Therefore, the three vectors ǫ1,1, ǫ1,−1, and kµ behave as a massless helicity semi-triplet in the sense that the
transverse ǫ1,±1 can not be reached by laddering from (ǫ1,0 − ez), at variance to the algebra in (57). This happens
because the n vector in (56) is normalizable and describes a purely time-like momentum, p2 = 1, while kµ in
(48) is not normalizable and describes a massless momentum, k2 = 0. Gauge symmetry is known to remove the
longitudinal degree of freedom both at the polarization vectors and quantum-state levels, and demands helicity
conservation.

The property of the translation generators to annihilate the kµ vector is, however, not universal. Inﬁnite dimen-
sional unitary carrier spaces (inﬁnite dimensional modules) can throughout be Πx and Πy eigenmodules with
non-vanishing eigenvalues. In this case, by acting on such carrier spaces by the Lz operator, inﬁnite massless
towers of equally spaced helicities are created, known under the name of “exotic”, “continuous”, or “inﬁnite” spin
modules, [20], [21] because the non-compact generators of the boosts, present in Πx and Πy, are not helicity
conserving. According to [22] Wigner’s exotic state can be associated with inﬁnite component Majorana ﬁelds,
appearing as discrete D±
α series of the SL(2, R) group (it has E(2), and SO(1, 2) as subgroups) and considered
in the limits of

• vanishing masses m → 0,
• inﬁnitely growing spins, s → ∞,
• constant ms → µ products, with µ providing new mass scales.

As an example, the set of nℓ hydrogen (H) atom states with a ﬁxed angular momentum value, ℓ, and a node-number
n growing from zero to inﬁnity, provide examples for inﬁnite component Majorana ﬁelds (with n taking the part of
“spin” index) as they can appear in composite systems. Taking into account the relative smallness of the binding
energy of (−13.6) eV of the H atom ground state relative to the electron mass of me ≈ 511 eV, the inﬁnite nℓ
towers in the H Atom spectrum could be considered as massless to a good approximation [23], thus providing a
reasonable illustrative example for an “exotic” massless state [22]. However, no elementary particles following
such patterns have been experimentally detected so far in Nature, although they are of interest to theories based in
higher than (1 + 3) dimensions [24], [25]). In ordinary Minkowski space–time such fundamental “exotic” states
have to be considered as non-physical, or, spurious. In restricting the E(2) carrier spaces to such with vanishing
Πx and Πy eigenvalues, the exotic states are excluded. As long as the maximal compact group of the little group
is SO(2) , which has only one-dimensional carrier spaces, each such space is characterized by helicity. The
fundamental CP T symmetry then requires that each state of helicity h has to be paired by an opposite helicity,
(−h), meaning that for each spin j one ﬁnds a massless particle of helicity j, and an antiparticle of helicity (−j).
Finally, the connection between the E(2) generators and the components of the Pauli-Lubanski vector can be
established. Indeed, in the case of px = py = 0, the Pauli-Lubanski vector is especially simple and reads,

In executing the calculation, one veriﬁes that this amounts to

(64)

(65)

For this reason, some authors [12] prefer representing the E(2) algebra in terms of the components of the Pauli-
Lubanski vector given in (64).

The main conclusion we draw from the present section is that Wigner’s little group approach to massless
four-vectors has the property to describe genuine motion on the null-rays of the light cone. In the Weyl spinor
approach such motions are described through their projections on subspaces of the light cone, given by SO(1, 2)
hyperboloids, thus re-phrasing the massless theory in terms of a massive one in a space time with one less spatial
dimension. The Weyl spinor approach becomes comparable with the E(2) method upon giving up the SO(1, 2)
irreducibility of the four-vectors in (57), and of ez in (44), in which case the combination in (61) becomes possible.

5 Massless (3/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 3/2) as totally anti-symmetric tensor-spinor

Here we construct the tensor-spinors of the massless Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld from the four vectors built in the
previous sections. The massless Majorana Rarita-Schwinger particles of interest here belong to the four-vector
spinor carrier space of the Lorentz group, here denoted by U µ and given by

(70)

(see discussion after the equation (57)). In what follows the p argument will be systematically suppressed for
the sake of notational brevity. In taking into account the standard deﬁnition of the totally anti-symmetric Lorentz
tensor of second rank,

which is divergenceless by virtue of equation (47), the following tensor-spinors are introduced:

Here, we further suppressed the Majorana spinor index to avoid overloading the notation and used the notation

According to (4) all the T (i)

± spaces designed in this way are 24 dimensional, reducible, and among their
irreducible building blocks one encounters one (3/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 3/2) irreducible tensor-spinor, that can be singled
out by the pure spin-3/2 projector given in (5), constructed in [11] as,

(75)

According to [8], the (3/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 3/2) carrier spaces of the Lorentz group are the only spin-3/2 representation
spaces that respect Weinberg’s theorem and are canonically quantizable. These new spin-3/2 degrees of freedom
satisfy the following relations,

− (cid:3)αβ
subscript (±) speciﬁes the helicity of the Majorana spinor, (+1/2) versus (−1/2). The tensor-spinors(cid:2)T (1)

of helicities, h = ±1/2, respectively, are expected to be ruled out by gauge invariance in a similar
way in which the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the four-vectors are removed. At the level of the states, these
helicities are excluded by the subtle Ward identities.

The most efﬁcient tool for the explicit construction of a (cid:2)w(3/2,0)i
tensor is using for Fµν in (72)–(74)
the presentation suggested by Uhlenbeck and Laporte in [26] and based on spinorial indices. According to [26],
one deﬁnes a totally symmetric tensor of second rank, whose components are, f11 = χ1χ1, f22 = χ2χ2 and
f12 = f21 = (χ1χ2 + χ2χ1)/2, and which represents the (1, 0) part from (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1). Analogously, for (0, 1)
one deﬁnes, f

F ij = −ǫijkHk.

Taking, then, the direct product of f σ
M in (34) will pick up from the latter the
components suited for producing a totally symmetric tensor of third rank with spinor components, i.e. f11 will
pick up ζ1, f22 will pick up ζ2, while f12 can pick up either χ1 to form Sym(f12χ1) , or χ2 to form Sym(f12χ2).
With χ1 and χ2 from (25) and rising and lowering the spinorial indices according to the prescription in (11)-(12)
the following F matrix is obtained:

f σ

τ =(cid:18) (E + pz)(px + ipy)

−(E + pz)2

(px + ipy)2

−(E + pz)(px + ipy) (cid:19)

This is a divergenceless tensor in accordance with

provides a representation of the (3/2, 0) part of a w(3/2,0)1
tensor spinor. The Ξαβγ tensor-spinor has four inde-
pendent components, χ1χ1χ1, χ2χ2χ2, Sym(χ1χ1χ2), and Sym(χ2χ2χ1) from which only the ﬁrst one survives
in the px = py = 0 gauge kinematics, as it should be. Notice that at the level of the spinorial indices it is the
symmetrization procedure that plays the same role as the projector P (3/2,0), given in (5), plays at the level of the

Lorentz indices. In now recalling that the Maxwell equations are obtained from,

as

(82)

(83)

and so on, one becomes aware how by working out the divergence of Ξαβγ upon its transformation to coordinate
space, ﬁeld equations for the gravitino of Maxwellian type could be encountered.

As an alternative, the massless limit of a Lagrangian for the Ξαβγ tensor, transformed to coordinate space and there

Here, σµ (cid:5)αα = (σ0,−~σ), ~σ = (σx, σy, σz), and σx, σy and σz are the Pauli matrices, and a and b are constant
parameters. In [28] the case of a tensor-spinor of second rank has been worked out along the lines of (85) by means
of the canonical constraint Hamiltonian quantization procedure and there it could be shown that for a + b = 1
the Hamiltonian is free from negative energy solutions and presents itself diagonal in the particle creation and
annihilation operators.

that the corresponding equations contain many more terms and thus provide more chances of avoiding instabilities
of the Hamiltonian through favourable cancellations in the calculations of Dirac brackets. Work on this extensive
program, initiated in [28], will be continued elsewhere.

6 Conclusions

In this work we presented the explicit construction of the massless Rarita-Schwinger four-vector spinors and the
related anti-symmetric tensor-spinors of pure spin-3/2, framed in the formulation of the free wave equation given
in (76) that is distinct from the one appearing in the Rarita-Schwinger framework [5]. The realization of this
construction became possible by virtue of our knowledge of the momentum independent Lorentz projector in (5),
earlier derived in [11], which served as a carrier space reduction tool. The wave equation in (76) satisﬁed by this
tensor-spinor seems reasonable in so far as it parallels the equation satisﬁed by the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor for
the case of free photons, ∂µFµν = 0. We also discussed the relation between the Weyl spinor approach to massless
four-vectors and Wigners little group method. In effect, we have shown that the Rarita-Schwinger approach to the
massless gravitino is not unique and have provided a different option, which in our opinion bears the potential of
being extendible to other high spins. In future work we shall examine the quantisation of this approach and the
coupling to an electromagnetic ﬁeld and compare the results to the more traditional formalism.
